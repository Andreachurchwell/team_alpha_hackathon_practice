Phase 1 (fast win): routes-only split

Don’t touch helpers yet. Just move endpoints into route files.

✅ Goal: /docs shows all endpoints and app still runs.

Assign by route file:

Person A: auth_routes.py

Person B: chat_routes.py

Person C: content_routes.py

Person D: system_routes.py

(1 Driver wires main.py)

This is the “we can do this” moment.


Phase 2 (cleanup): shared helpers

After routes are split and stable, you extract helpers:

security into core/security.py

db stuff into data/database.py

chat/content logic into services/
